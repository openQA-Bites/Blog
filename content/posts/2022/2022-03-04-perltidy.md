A commen error when running `tools/tidy` in the [openSUSE/SLES tests repository for openQA](https://github.com/os-autoinst/os-autoinst-distri-opensuse) is the following error:

    Wrong version of perltidy. Found '20211027', expected '20211029'.

This indicated a mismatch of the found vs. expected version of perltidy and the tidy script aborts to avoid inconsistent formatting between your PR and the CI pipeline. In Perl this is unfortunately necessary, as often a new version of `perltidy` formats the code differently.

## Update perltidy in os-autoinst

Please be so kind and update the required version of `perltidy` in the [os-autoinst](https://github.com/os-autoinst/os-autoinst) repository.

See e.g. https://github.com/os-autoinst/os-autoinst/pull/2372.

## Force a local solution

If you really need to manually force a local solution, you can manually update the `cpanfile` in your `os-autoinst` folder within the [osado](https://github.com/os-autoinst/os-autoinst-distri-opensuse) repo on your machine to match the current version you have:

```
requires 'Perl::Tidy', '== 20211027';
```

## What is `tools/tidy` ?

`tools/tidy` is a handy tool that re-formats all modified perl files in the [os-autoinst-distri-opensuse](https://github.com/os-autoinst/os-autoinst-distri-opensuse) repository. This is not only a good habit to do but also necessary before creating a pull request, as otherwise the CI pipeline would fail.

Another handy tools is `make test-static` that runs a set of static tests to avoid common issues before creating pull requests.
