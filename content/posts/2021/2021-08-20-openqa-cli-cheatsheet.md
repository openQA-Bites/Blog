Checkout the new [openqa-cli cheat sheet page](/openqa/openqa-cli-cheat-sheet/) where I start to collect some useful "how do I do ..." snippets for the openQA CLI utility `openqa-cli`.

The page aims at being a quick ready-to-be-use reference cheat sheet and not a complimentary documentation. Feel free to send me further suggestions via email or chat.

PS. Happy 100th birthday, [Gene Roddenberry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Roddenberry)!
