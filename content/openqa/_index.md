openQA is an automated test tool for operating systems and the engine at the heart of openSUSE's automated testing initiative (from [open.qa](https://open.qa/)). openQA is our main automation test environment and our daily bread and butter.

Here in this openqa section you find some static openQA content. Cheat-sheets, tutorials and other stuff, that doesn't fit the format of a blog post. Also those pages are updated continuously.
