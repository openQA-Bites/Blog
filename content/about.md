openQA bites is a blog about tutorials, insights and love stories from a simple openQA developer. It aims to provide small and bite-sized posts about typical usage issues that every openQA dev encounters and atypical corner-cases that are worth to be written down.
In the best case it can complement the official [openQA documentation](http://open.qa/documentation/). by sharing some stories and make some typical and atypical use cases searchable in via your search engine of choice.

This blog contains openQA related content. I also run a personal blog on [feldspaten.org](https://feldspaten.org/), where you find more personal stuff. The source code of this blog is on [GitHub](https://github.com/openQA-Bites). The blog is powered by [hugo](gohugo.io/) for fun and for glory. The theme is [Beautiful Hugo](https://github.com/halogenica/beautifulhugo).
